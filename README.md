# 👋 Hi there, I’m Keyla

I’m a behavioral analyst turned data explorer, driven by a deep curiosity for what numbers don’t always say out loud. I believe data isn't just a trail of facts—it's human behavior encoded in patterns. My mission? To decode those stories, solve meaningful problems, and prevent the ones no one’s talking about yet.

## 🔍 What I Do

I build bridges between raw data and real-world insights, using Python, Pandas, and SQL as my compass. With a background in psychology and years of applied experience analyzing human behavior, I approach datasets like layered narratives—each with cause, consequence, and potential.

I’m analytical but never detached, creative but never chaotic. I don’t just clean and model data—I listen to it.

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Google Colab, Excel  
- **Skills:** Data wrangling, EDA, feature engineering, predictive modeling, insight communication

## 🚀 Projects

### 🎮 *Video Game Sales Analysis*
**[December 2024]**
- Explored global sales trends across genres, platforms, and regions  
- Cleaned, transformed, and visualized complex datasets to uncover behavior-based patterns  
- Identified actionable insights for marketing and product strategy using Matplotlib  
- Asked (and answered): *What really makes a game a global hit?*

### 🪙 *Gold Yield Prediction for Zyfra*
**[April 2025]**
- Built a machine learning model to forecast gold extraction efficiency  
- Conducted rigorous feature selection and preprocessing to improve accuracy and interpretability  
- Helped translate industrial data into cost-saving insights and strategic decision support  
- Answered the business-critical question: *Where is optimization hiding in plain sight?*

## 🎯 Where I'm Headed

I’m exploring the intersection of behavioral science and data—curious about how we make decisions, what drives engagement, and how data can be more human-aware. Whether it’s market research, product optimization, or social impact, I believe the future belongs to those who ask better questions.
